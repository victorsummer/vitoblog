Lots of Qt freshers asked me how to become a Qt master, since Qt is becoming more and more powerful in both UI creation and logic implementation.

Below I made a Qt learning roadmap for you to help you learn Qt systematically and become a master of the latest Qt technology.

You might need to omit some of the steps such as building Linux image with Yocto if you don't plan to work with embedded Linux.

Anyway, just follow the learning road map from the top to the bottom with your best effort, you surely will become a Qt expert.
However, if you would like to save your time and effort, or if you would like to build a Qt experts team in a short time, don't hesitant to contact me, because I can provide you and your team with the best trainings and practices according to your own demands.
